# Final Project


The Enron Corporation went bankrupt in 2011 and was one of the biggest audit failures in American history (Wikipedia, 2016a). 
On the aftermath of the bankruptcy a database of emails from employees of the Enron Corporation was acquired by the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission in order to investigate the company's collapse (Wikipedia, 2016b). At the end of the investigation 
the email database was put on the public domain to be used for historical research and academic purposes.

The Enron corpus is therefore the starting point of our investigation. We want to use our newly acquired knowledge of machine 
learning techniques to build a classifier which can identify people of interest in the Enron scandal.

The code of to train the classifier is [here](https://github.com/zelite/Identify-fraud-from-enron-email/blob/master/final_project/poi_id.py).
